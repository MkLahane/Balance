# Balance-
This is a simple game that I made with ml5 and p5.js. 
Your task in the game is to control 2 rectangles and dodge obstacles. You can control the 2 cars by your hand movement. Just make sure when the game starts your 
standing at reasonable distance from your webcam so that both of your hands are seen in the frame. So when the left hand is moved to the left the left side rectanlge switches to the left lane, you bent it to the right it then shifts to the right lane. The movement logic is similar for the right hand which will control the right side rectangle.
This project is inspired by the following video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYgYyq-xqAw&amp;t=1s
